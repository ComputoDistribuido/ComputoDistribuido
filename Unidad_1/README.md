# Lesson 1 
## What is a distributed system?

_An distribuited system it's a state divided over multiple computers. It's not a centralized system, this system is one where  the state of your system and the program is stored on a single computer._

##### Some examples about systems using a distributed system in real world
- Domanin Name System (DNS)
- Facebook & Google use distributed systems
- Email Servers (SMTP)
- Phone Networks

# Lesson 2 
## Why build a distributed system?
_On this lesson we onboard use cases on which we need to use or build a distributed system, next up are some examples of case scenarios where a distributed system would be a great approach._ 

- **Heavily intense computing applications that require a lot of processing**, for example a voice recognition system, for this type of application a distributed system would be a great choice, for example the vast majority of voice recognition system today, share the processing, first the device receiving or listening it’s only in charge of capturing the sound and sending it to a server with much more computing capacities, which is going to process the voice and return something to the other device


 - **Decentralized networks** are a great example of distributed systems, this where born from the necessity of not having to rely on one server or one node, instead the network its kept alive and it’s live on each and every node of the network, a real example would be the bitcoin network it is a decentralized network with millions of nodes computing and validating each transaction.
